Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!

Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Why would I want to know that? It's toe-tappingly tragic! Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!

Professor, make a woman out of me. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".

Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.

Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. That's theONLY thing about being a slave.

Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? No, just a regular mistake. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.

Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.

Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. File not found. No! The cat shelter's on to me. Bender, quit destroying the universe!

The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.

Why did you bring us here? Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. A sexy mistake. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?Ven ve voe up, ve had zese wodies. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. And then the battle's not so bad? Tell her she looks thin.

Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. File not found. Ow, my spirit!

Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! I can explain. It's very valuable. Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!
